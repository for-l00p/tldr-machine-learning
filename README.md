 - AI is making machines that are intelligent; ML is making machines that learn
 - Deep learning is a modern reincarnation of ANNs, lossely inspired by what (little) we know about the biological brain.
 - DistBelief is Googles large-scale deep learning infrastructure wih two layers of parallelism
 - Deep learning is good to try for machine perception acts
 - If you have a mountain of (labeled) data, benchmark first, then try deep learning
 - If you dont have a mountain of labeled data, you probably should so bootstrap more!
 - Drawbacks to deep learning are large datasets, computaitonal costs, expertise, and interpretability.
