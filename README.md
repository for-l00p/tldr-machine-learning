[Google Large Scale NN Project - video] (http://youtu.be/KELYHjq9Gbs) - [FULL SUMMARY] (https://github.com/mlaico/tldr-machine-learning/blob/master/googles-large-scale-deep-learning.md)
 - DistBelief is Googles large-scale deep learning infrastructure wih two layers of parallelism
 - Deep learning is good to try for machine perception acts
 - If you have a mountain of (labeled) data, benchmark first, then try deep learning

[Ilya Sutskever: A Brief Overview of Deep Learning - post] (http://yyue.blogspot.ca/2015/01/a-brief-overview-of-deep-learning.html) - [FULL SUMMARY] (https://github.com/mlaico/tldr-machine-learning/blob/master/a-brief-overview-of-deep-learning.md)
 - LDNNs are powerful
 - LDNNs are trainable if we have a very fast computer
 - If we have a very large high-quality dataset, we can find the best LDNN for the task

[Neural Turing Machines - paper] (http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) - [FULL SUMMARY] (https://github.com/mlaico/tldr-machine-learning/blob/master/neural-turing-machines.md)
 - A neural network (RNN or FF) that accesses a memory matrix through "attentional processes"
 - Differential end-to-end - trainable through SGD
 - Can learn simple algorithms: copy, sort, etc
